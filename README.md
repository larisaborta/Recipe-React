# Recipe-React
There has been used a free API to create a recipe app using React. The main focus was to understand React and not CSS.
Things covered in this project:

- Fetch data from an api with react
- How useState and useEffect work
- How to pass down data in react with props

/*Use npm start to run the code*/
